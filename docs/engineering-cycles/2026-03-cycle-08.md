# Engineering Cycle Record — 2026-03 Cycle 08

## Cycle Metadata

- Cycle ID/Name: 2026-03 Cycle 08
- Date: 2026-03-01
- Owner: epsilva09 + GitHub Copilot
- Related issue/task: Progress presets aligned with important attributes
  list
- Branch/PR: `main`

## Goals

- Reuse the existing project list of important attributes in progress
  preset logic.
- Replace near-completion preset semantics with important-attributes
  semantics.
- Keep URL compatibility and avoid regressions in existing filter flows.

## Implemented Changes

### 1) Performance

- No backend/runtime performance changes in this cycle.

### 2) Quality / Reliability

- Preset filtering now uses a stable project source of truth
  (`SPECIAL_ATTRIBUTES`).
- Preserved URL compatibility by mapping legacy `near` preset to
  `important`.

### 3) Architecture / Maintainability

- Added `progress_important_attributes` helper in
  `app/helpers/armories_helper.rb` sourced from
  `CompareCollectionsService::SPECIAL_ATTRIBUTES`.
- Passed important attributes list into progress Stimulus controller via
  data attribute.
- Updated Stimulus preset logic to match entries by important status
  attributes.

### 4) UX / Accessibility

- Replaced the quick preset label/behavior from near completion to
  important attributes.
- Kept preset controls and empty-state interactions consistent.

## Risks / Trade-offs

- Important-attributes matching depends on normalized status strings;
  mitigated by reusing existing normalization logic already used in
  filter options.

## Definition of Done

### Functional

- [x] Behavior implemented matches intended user workflow.
- [x] New interactions are deterministic (no random layout jumps).
- [x] URL/state persistence is intentional and backwards-compatible.

### Performance

- [x] Expensive remote or CPU-heavy paths are cached where sensible.
- [x] New loops/parsing avoid repeated work when possible.
- [x] Added/updated instrumentation for new hot paths.

### Reliability

- [x] Error handling returns user-friendly and localized feedback.
- [x] Edge cases (empty data, malformed data, unavailable API) covered.
- [x] No mutation leaks from cached/shared objects.

### Code Quality

- [x] No avoidable duplication of defaults/constants.
- [x] View templates stay mostly presentational (logic in helper/service).
- [x] Naming and file structure follow existing project conventions.

### UX / A11y

- [x] Keyboard navigation works for new controls.
- [x] Focus indicators are visible and consistent.
- [x] Color contrast/readability remains acceptable on dark theme.
- [x] Mobile/tablet behavior reviewed for overflow and spacing.

### Verification

- [x] Relevant targeted tests pass.
- [x] Full test suite passes (`bin/rails test`).
- [x] No new warnings/errors from editor diagnostics.

## Validation Evidence

- Commands executed
  - `bundle exec rake lint:md`
  - `bundle exec rake lint`
  - `bundle exec rails test`
- Results
  - Markdown lint passed.
  - Combined lint passed.
  - Test suite passed (`21 runs, 0 failures, 0 errors`).
