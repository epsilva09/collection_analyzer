# Engineering Cycle Record — 2026-03 Cycle 07

## Cycle Metadata

- Cycle ID/Name: 2026-03 Cycle 07
- Date: 2026-03-01
- Owner: epsilva09 + GitHub Copilot
- Related issue/task: Progress filters UX refinement (Sprint B)
- Branch/PR: `main`

## Goals

- Add quick filter presets for faster exploration.
- Improve empty-result feedback with contextual UI actions.
- Keep filter UX cohesive with existing persistence and accessibility.

## Implemented Changes

### 1) Performance

- No backend/runtime performance changes in this cycle.

### 2) Quality / Reliability

- Preserved existing filter behavior while layering presets and empty-state.
- Kept URL persistence compatible through additional preset query param.

### 3) Architecture / Maintainability

- Extended `progress_filters_controller.js` with:
  - preset state and matching logic (`all`, `near`, `with_items`)
  - URL load/persist for preset (`f_preset`)
  - empty-state toggling and preset button state updates
- Added preset/empty-state markup in `progress.html.erb` with explicit
  Stimulus targets and actions.

### 4) UX / Accessibility

- Added quick preset buttons to accelerate common filtering paths:
  - `Todos`
  - `Quase concluídas`
  - `Com itens faltando`
- Removed `Sem itens faltando` preset because this screen does not show
  100% collections.
- Added contextual empty-state block with direct “clear and show all” action.
- Preserved and improved accessibility with `aria-pressed` on presets and
  meaningful chip button labels.

## Risks / Trade-offs

- Additional preset logic increases client-side complexity; mitigated by
  keeping logic centralized in the existing Stimulus controller.

## Definition of Done

### Functional

- [x] Behavior implemented matches intended user workflow.
- [x] New interactions are deterministic (no random layout jumps).
- [x] URL/state persistence is intentional and backwards-compatible.

### Performance

- [x] Expensive remote or CPU-heavy paths are cached where sensible.
- [x] New loops/parsing avoid repeated work when possible.
- [x] Added/updated instrumentation for new hot paths.

### Reliability

- [x] Error handling returns user-friendly and localized feedback.
- [x] Edge cases (empty data, malformed data, unavailable API) covered.
- [x] No mutation leaks from cached/shared objects.

### Code Quality

- [x] No avoidable duplication of defaults/constants.
- [x] View templates stay mostly presentational (logic in helper/service).
- [x] Naming and file structure follow existing project conventions.

### UX / A11y

- [x] Keyboard navigation works for new controls.
- [x] Focus indicators are visible and consistent.
- [x] Color contrast/readability remains acceptable on dark theme.
- [x] Mobile/tablet behavior reviewed for overflow and spacing.

### Verification

- [x] Relevant targeted tests pass.
- [x] Full test suite passes (`bin/rails test`).
- [x] No new warnings/errors from editor diagnostics.

## Validation Evidence

- Commands executed
  - `bundle exec rake lint:md`
  - `bundle exec rake lint`
  - `bundle exec rails test`
- Results
  - Markdown lint passed.
  - Combined lint passed.
  - Test suite passed (`21 runs, 0 failures, 0 errors`).
