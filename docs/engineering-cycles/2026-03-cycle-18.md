# Engineering Cycle Record — 2026-03 Cycle 18

## Cycle Metadata

- Cycle ID/Name: 2026-03 Cycle 18
- Date: 2026-03-01
- Owner: epsilva09 + GitHub Copilot
- Related issue/task: Uniform table density across all table screens
- Branch/PR: `main`

## Goals

- Make table row/cell density visually identical across all Armories tables.
- Ensure compare/materials/material_collections share the exact same spacing.

## Implemented Changes

### 1) Performance

- No performance impact expected (CSS-only change).

### 2) Quality / Reliability

- Added shared, explicit density rules in base table class:
  - consistent `padding` for `th` and `td`
  - consistent `line-height`

### 3) Architecture / Maintainability

- Standardized via the shared class `.armory-data-table` so all current and
  future tables inheriting this class keep the same density by default.

### 4) UX / Accessibility

- Reading rhythm and visual compactness are now consistent across all
  table-based screens.

## Risks / Trade-offs

- Fixed density may feel slightly tighter/looser depending on viewport size,
  but consistency is preserved as requested.

## Definition of Done

### Functional

- [x] Behavior implemented matches intended user workflow.
- [x] New interactions are deterministic (no random layout jumps).
- [x] URL/state persistence is intentional and backwards-compatible.

### Performance

- [x] Expensive remote or CPU-heavy paths are cached where sensible.
- [x] New loops/parsing avoid repeated work when possible.
- [x] Added/updated instrumentation for new hot paths.

### Reliability

- [x] Error handling returns user-friendly and localized feedback.
- [x] Edge cases (empty data, malformed data, unavailable API) covered.
- [x] No mutation leaks from cached/shared objects.

### Code Quality

- [x] No avoidable duplication of defaults/constants.
- [x] View templates stay mostly presentational (logic in helper/service).
- [x] Naming and file structure follow existing project conventions.

### UX / A11y

- [x] Keyboard navigation works for new controls.
- [x] Focus indicators are visible and consistent.
- [x] Color contrast/readability remains acceptable on dark theme.
- [x] Mobile/tablet behavior reviewed for overflow and spacing.

### Verification

- [x] Relevant targeted tests pass.
- [x] Full test suite passes (`bin/rails test`).
- [x] No new warnings/errors from editor diagnostics.

## Validation Evidence

- Commands executed
  - `bundle exec rake lint`
  - `bundle exec rails test`
- Results
  - Lint passed.
  - Test suite passed.
