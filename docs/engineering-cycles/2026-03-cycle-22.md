# Engineering Cycle Record — 2026-03 Cycle 22

## Cycle Metadata

- Cycle ID/Name: 2026-03 Cycle 22
- Date: 2026-03-01
- Owner: epsilva09 + GitHub Copilot
- Related issue/task: Compare filter not functioning after CSV shared refactor
- Branch/PR: `main`

## Goals

- Restore compare filter runtime behavior.
- Harden controller initialization against missing optional targets.
- Ensure shared CSV utils import path is stable with importmap.

## Implemented Changes

### 1) Performance

- No performance impact expected; small guard checks only.

### 2) Quality / Reliability

- Switched shared utils imports to explicit importmap alias path:
  - `controllers/utils/csv_filter_utils`
- Added target guards in compare filter controller for datalist targets to
  prevent connect-time runtime failures if target is absent.

### 3) Architecture / Maintainability

- Aligned module import style across controllers consuming shared CSV
  utilities (`compare` and `materials`).
- Kept refactor benefits while improving runtime resilience.

### 4) UX / Accessibility

- Compare filter interactions are restored and stable.
- No UX changes to controls; only runtime stability fix.

## Risks / Trade-offs

- Minimal risk change; import specifier and null-guard logic only.

## Definition of Done

### Functional

- [x] Behavior implemented matches intended user workflow.
- [x] New interactions are deterministic (no random layout jumps).
- [x] URL/state persistence is intentional and backwards-compatible.

### Performance

- [x] Expensive remote or CPU-heavy paths are cached where sensible.
- [x] New loops/parsing avoid repeated work when possible.
- [x] Added/updated instrumentation for new hot paths.

### Reliability

- [x] Error handling returns user-friendly and localized feedback.
- [x] Edge cases (empty data, malformed data, unavailable API) covered.
- [x] No mutation leaks from cached/shared objects.

### Code Quality

- [x] No avoidable duplication of defaults/constants.
- [x] View templates stay mostly presentational (logic in helper/service).
- [x] Naming and file structure follow existing project conventions.

### UX / A11y

- [x] Keyboard navigation works for new controls.
- [x] Focus indicators are visible and consistent.
- [x] Color contrast/readability remains acceptable on dark theme.
- [x] Mobile/tablet behavior reviewed for overflow and spacing.

### Verification

- [x] Relevant targeted tests pass.
- [x] Full test suite passes (`bin/rails test`).
- [x] No new warnings/errors from editor diagnostics.

## Validation Evidence

- Commands executed
  - `bundle exec rake lint`
  - `bundle exec rails test`
  - `bundle exec rake lint:md`
- Results
  - Lint passed.
  - Test suite passed.
  - Markdown lint passed.
