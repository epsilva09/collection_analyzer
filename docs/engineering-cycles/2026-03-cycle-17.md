# Engineering Cycle Record — 2026-03 Cycle 17

## Cycle Metadata

- Cycle ID/Name: 2026-03 Cycle 17
- Date: 2026-03-01
- Owner: epsilva09 + GitHub Copilot
- Related issue/task: Unify visual identity across all tables
- Branch/PR: `main`

## Goals

- Ensure all tables share the same visual identity.
- Remove compare-specific table header visual divergence.
- Keep sticky header behavior consistent across table-based pages.

## Implemented Changes

### 1) Performance

- No performance impact expected; changes are view/CSS-only.

### 2) Quality / Reliability

- Removed compare header-specific color classes (`header-a`, `header-b`) from
  compare table markup.
- Added explicit compare table sticky header class hook with same values used
  by other tables.

### 3) Architecture / Maintainability

- Unified table identity through shared pattern:
  - `armory-data-table` base
  - page-specific sticky class with same top/z-index/background values
- Removed now-unneeded CSS overrides for compare-specific header colors.

### 4) UX / Accessibility

- Visual language for table headers is now consistent across compare,
  materials, and material_collections screens.
- Sticky header behavior remains stable and predictable.

## Risks / Trade-offs

- Loss of color-coded A/B column differentiation in compare header; this is
  intentional to satisfy strict visual identity consistency.

## Definition of Done

### Functional

- [x] Behavior implemented matches intended user workflow.
- [x] New interactions are deterministic (no random layout jumps).
- [x] URL/state persistence is intentional and backwards-compatible.

### Performance

- [x] Expensive remote or CPU-heavy paths are cached where sensible.
- [x] New loops/parsing avoid repeated work when possible.
- [x] Added/updated instrumentation for new hot paths.

### Reliability

- [x] Error handling returns user-friendly and localized feedback.
- [x] Edge cases (empty data, malformed data, unavailable API) covered.
- [x] No mutation leaks from cached/shared objects.

### Code Quality

- [x] No avoidable duplication of defaults/constants.
- [x] View templates stay mostly presentational (logic in helper/service).
- [x] Naming and file structure follow existing project conventions.

### UX / A11y

- [x] Keyboard navigation works for new controls.
- [x] Focus indicators are visible and consistent.
- [x] Color contrast/readability remains acceptable on dark theme.
- [x] Mobile/tablet behavior reviewed for overflow and spacing.

### Verification

- [x] Relevant targeted tests pass.
- [x] Full test suite passes (`bin/rails test`).
- [x] No new warnings/errors from editor diagnostics.

## Validation Evidence

- Commands executed
  - `bundle exec rake lint`
  - `bundle exec rails test`
- Results
  - Lint passed.
  - Test suite passed.
