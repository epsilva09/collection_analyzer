# Engineering Cycle Record — 2026-03 Cycle 12

## Cycle Metadata

- Cycle ID/Name: 2026-03 Cycle 12
- Date: 2026-03-01
- Owner: epsilva09 + GitHub Copilot
- Related issue/task: Sticky parity on Progress filters
- Branch/PR: `main`

## Goals

- Replicate sticky-scroll filter behavior from Materials into Progress.
- Keep sticky calculations robust on resize and filter-state updates.
- Preserve current Progress UX (no structural changes in list rendering).

## Implemented Changes

### 1) Performance

- Sticky offset is calculated from the real filters card height and updated
  only on connect, apply, and resize events.

### 2) Quality / Reliability

- Added lifecycle-safe resize listener management in
  `progress_filters_controller.js`.
- Added deterministic CSS variable update for sticky offset in Progress.

### 3) Architecture / Maintainability

- Added dedicated `filtersCard` target in Progress view/controller,
  mirroring the Materials pattern.
- Added scoped `progress-data-table` sticky header CSS hook for
  consistency with existing sticky design primitives.

### 4) UX / Accessibility

- Progress filters now maintain stable sticky behavior while users scroll
  long results.
- Kept existing keyboard/filter interactions intact.

## Notes

- Progress currently renders collection entries as `list-group` blocks, not
  tables, so there is no rendered table header (`thead`) on this page to
  make sticky without changing the current UX structure.

## Risks / Trade-offs

- Sticky offset depends on computed card height; mitigated by recalculation
  on apply/resize.

## Definition of Done

### Functional

- [x] Behavior implemented matches intended user workflow.
- [x] New interactions are deterministic (no random layout jumps).
- [x] URL/state persistence is intentional and backwards-compatible.

### Performance

- [x] Expensive remote or CPU-heavy paths are cached where sensible.
- [x] New loops/parsing avoid repeated work when possible.
- [x] Added/updated instrumentation for new hot paths.

### Reliability

- [x] Error handling returns user-friendly and localized feedback.
- [x] Edge cases (empty data, malformed data, unavailable API) covered.
- [x] No mutation leaks from cached/shared objects.

### Code Quality

- [x] No avoidable duplication of defaults/constants.
- [x] View templates stay mostly presentational (logic in helper/service).
- [x] Naming and file structure follow existing project conventions.

### UX / A11y

- [x] Keyboard navigation works for new controls.
- [x] Focus indicators are visible and consistent.
- [x] Color contrast/readability remains acceptable on dark theme.
- [x] Mobile/tablet behavior reviewed for overflow and spacing.

### Verification

- [x] Relevant targeted tests pass.
- [x] Full test suite passes (`bin/rails test`).
- [x] No new warnings/errors from editor diagnostics.

## Validation Evidence

- Commands executed
  - `bundle exec rake lint:md`
  - `bundle exec rake lint`
  - `bundle exec rails test`
- Results
  - Markdown lint passed.
  - Combined lint passed.
  - Test suite passed.
