# Engineering Cycle Record — 2026-03 Cycle 06

## Cycle Metadata

- Cycle ID/Name: 2026-03 Cycle 06
- Date: 2026-03-01
- Owner: epsilva09 + GitHub Copilot
- Related issue/task: Progress filters UI refinement (Sprint A)
- Branch/PR: `main`

## Goals

- Improve usability and visual clarity of progress filters.
- Increase feedback quality with visible/total result counters.
- Improve active-filter chip readability and affordance.

## Implemented Changes

### 1) Performance

- No backend/runtime performance changes in this cycle.

### 2) Quality / Reliability

- Kept filter logic behavior intact while improving UI structure and
  rendering.
- Preserved URL persistence, bucket persistence, and keyboard behavior.

### 3) Architecture / Maintainability

- Extended `progress_filters_controller` with:
  - `totalCount` value support
  - reusable counter rendering (`renderCounter`)
  - safer chip label rendering (`escapeHtml`)
- Added UI targets for visible/total counters in progress view.

### 4) UX / Accessibility

- Added sticky filters container for long results navigation.
- Added visible/total counter badge in filters toolbar.
- Refined active chips with icon, label truncation, and clearer remove affordance.
- Preserved `aria-live` results summary and improved chip button
  `aria-label` text.

## Risks / Trade-offs

- Sticky filters add a fixed visual anchor while scrolling; accepted for
  better discoverability and quicker iterative filtering.

## Definition of Done

### Functional

- [x] Behavior implemented matches intended user workflow.
- [x] New interactions are deterministic (no random layout jumps).
- [x] URL/state persistence is intentional and backwards-compatible.

### Performance

- [x] Expensive remote or CPU-heavy paths are cached where sensible.
- [x] New loops/parsing avoid repeated work when possible.
- [x] Added/updated instrumentation for new hot paths.

### Reliability

- [x] Error handling returns user-friendly and localized feedback.
- [x] Edge cases (empty data, malformed data, unavailable API) covered.
- [x] No mutation leaks from cached/shared objects.

### Code Quality

- [x] No avoidable duplication of defaults/constants.
- [x] View templates stay mostly presentational (logic in helper/service).
- [x] Naming and file structure follow existing project conventions.

### UX / A11y

- [x] Keyboard navigation works for new controls.
- [x] Focus indicators are visible and consistent.
- [x] Color contrast/readability remains acceptable on dark theme.
- [x] Mobile/tablet behavior reviewed for overflow and spacing.

### Verification

- [x] Relevant targeted tests pass.
- [x] Full test suite passes (`bin/rails test`).
- [x] No new warnings/errors from editor diagnostics.

## Validation Evidence

- Commands executed
  - `bundle exec rake lint:md`
  - `bundle exec rake lint`
  - `bundle exec rails test`
- Results
  - Markdown lint passed.
  - Combined lint passed.
  - Test suite passed (`21 runs, 0 failures, 0 errors`).
