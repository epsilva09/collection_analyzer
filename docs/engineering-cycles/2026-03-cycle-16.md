# Engineering Cycle Record — 2026-03 Cycle 16

## Cycle Metadata

- Cycle ID/Name: 2026-03 Cycle 16
- Date: 2026-03-01
- Owner: epsilva09 + GitHub Copilot
- Related issue/task: Keep table headers fixed without dynamic displacement
- Branch/PR: `main`

## Goals

- Keep table headers fixed consistently.
- Remove dynamic JS offset logic that was causing visual drift.
- Simplify sticky behavior for easier predictability and maintenance.

## Implemented Changes

### 1) Performance

- Removed scroll/resize sticky offset recalculations from filters
  controllers, reducing event-driven recomputation.

### 2) Quality / Reliability

- Replaced variable sticky offsets with fixed `top` values in CSS for:
  - materials tables
  - material collections tables
  - progress table hook
- Prevented layout instability caused by runtime offset updates.

### 3) Architecture / Maintainability

- Removed dynamic sticky offset code paths from:
  - `materials_filters_controller.js`
  - `material_collections_filters_controller.js`
- Sticky header behavior is now declarative and centralized in CSS.

### 4) UX / Accessibility

- Headers stay fixed in a stable position while scrolling.
- Visual behavior no longer oscillates based on filter card height.

## Risks / Trade-offs

- Fixed top value (`0.75rem`) is globally consistent but less adaptive to
  future major layout height changes; can be tuned if UI structure changes.

## Definition of Done

### Functional

- [x] Behavior implemented matches intended user workflow.
- [x] New interactions are deterministic (no random layout jumps).
- [x] URL/state persistence is intentional and backwards-compatible.

### Performance

- [x] Expensive remote or CPU-heavy paths are cached where sensible.
- [x] New loops/parsing avoid repeated work when possible.
- [x] Added/updated instrumentation for new hot paths.

### Reliability

- [x] Error handling returns user-friendly and localized feedback.
- [x] Edge cases (empty data, malformed data, unavailable API) covered.
- [x] No mutation leaks from cached/shared objects.

### Code Quality

- [x] No avoidable duplication of defaults/constants.
- [x] View templates stay mostly presentational (logic in helper/service).
- [x] Naming and file structure follow existing project conventions.

### UX / A11y

- [x] Keyboard navigation works for new controls.
- [x] Focus indicators are visible and consistent.
- [x] Color contrast/readability remains acceptable on dark theme.
- [x] Mobile/tablet behavior reviewed for overflow and spacing.

### Verification

- [x] Relevant targeted tests pass.
- [x] Full test suite passes (`bin/rails test`).
- [x] No new warnings/errors from editor diagnostics.

## Validation Evidence

- Commands executed
  - `bundle exec rake lint`
  - `bundle exec rails test`
- Results
  - Lint passed.
  - Test suite passed.
