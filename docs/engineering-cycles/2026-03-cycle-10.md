# Engineering Cycle Record — 2026-03 Cycle 10

## Cycle Metadata

- Cycle ID/Name: 2026-03 Cycle 10
- Date: 2026-03-01
- Owner: epsilva09 + GitHub Copilot
- Related issue/task: Materials filters URL persistence
- Branch/PR: `main`

## Goals

- Persist materials filters in URL for shareable filtered views.
- Restore filter state on page reload/navigation.
- Keep behavior aligned with progress filters pattern.

## Implemented Changes

### 1) Performance

- No backend/runtime performance changes in this cycle.

### 2) Quality / Reliability

- Added deterministic URL read/write behavior for materials filters.
- Preserved existing filtering semantics while adding persistence.

### 3) Architecture / Maintainability

- Extended `materials_filters_controller.js` with:
  - query param keys (`f_material`, `f_bucket`)
  - load filters from URL on connect
  - persist filters to URL after apply/clear
  - shared param persistence helper

### 4) UX / Accessibility

- Filter state is now retained on refresh and shareable via URL.
- User can return to the same filtered view without retyping filters.

## Risks / Trade-offs

- URL updates on each filter interaction increase history state updates;
  mitigated via `replaceState` (no history stack noise).

## Definition of Done

### Functional

- [x] Behavior implemented matches intended user workflow.
- [x] New interactions are deterministic (no random layout jumps).
- [x] URL/state persistence is intentional and backwards-compatible.

### Performance

- [x] Expensive remote or CPU-heavy paths are cached where sensible.
- [x] New loops/parsing avoid repeated work when possible.
- [x] Added/updated instrumentation for new hot paths.

### Reliability

- [x] Error handling returns user-friendly and localized feedback.
- [x] Edge cases (empty data, malformed data, unavailable API) covered.
- [x] No mutation leaks from cached/shared objects.

### Code Quality

- [x] No avoidable duplication of defaults/constants.
- [x] View templates stay mostly presentational (logic in helper/service).
- [x] Naming and file structure follow existing project conventions.

### UX / A11y

- [x] Keyboard navigation works for new controls.
- [x] Focus indicators are visible and consistent.
- [x] Color contrast/readability remains acceptable on dark theme.
- [x] Mobile/tablet behavior reviewed for overflow and spacing.

### Verification

- [x] Relevant targeted tests pass.
- [x] Full test suite passes (`bin/rails test`).
- [x] No new warnings/errors from editor diagnostics.

## Validation Evidence

- Commands executed
  - `bundle exec rake lint:md`
  - `bundle exec rake lint`
  - `bundle exec rails test`
- Results
  - Markdown lint passed.
  - Combined lint passed.
  - Test suite passed (`21 runs, 0 failures, 0 errors`).
