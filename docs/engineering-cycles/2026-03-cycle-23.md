# Engineering Cycle Record — 2026-03 Cycle 23

## Cycle Metadata

- Cycle ID/Name: 2026-03 Cycle 23
- Date: 2026-03-01
- Owner: epsilva09 + GitHub Copilot
- Related issue/task: Strengthen overall automated test suite
- Branch/PR: `main`

## Goals

- Increase project-wide confidence via high-value automated tests.
- Cover recently added filter UX in controller rendering tests.
- Add helper-level tests for filter option and normalization behavior.

## Implemented Changes

### 1) Performance

- No runtime production impact; tests-only changes.

### 2) Quality / Reliability

- Added controller integration tests for critical UI contracts:
  - compare detailed filters rendered with required targets/options
  - material collections filters rendered with filter metadata rows
- Expanded helper coverage for filter-related transformations and
  dedup/sort behavior.

### 3) Architecture / Maintainability

- New helper test suite file:
  - `test/helpers/armories_helper_test.rb`
- Extended existing controller test file:
  - `test/controllers/armories_controller_test.rb`
- Tests focus on stable contracts (selectors/data attributes/i18n-backed
  labels) to guard against regressions from future refactors.

### 4) UX / Accessibility

- Protects behavior of filter controls and row metadata expected by
  Stimulus controllers, improving reliability of interactive flows.

## Risks / Trade-offs

- Selector-based tests can require updates if markup structure changes;
  this is acceptable to preserve UX contracts.

## Definition of Done

### Functional

- [x] Behavior implemented matches intended user workflow.
- [x] New interactions are deterministic (no random layout jumps).
- [x] URL/state persistence is intentional and backwards-compatible.

### Performance

- [x] Expensive remote or CPU-heavy paths are cached where sensible.
- [x] New loops/parsing avoid repeated work when possible.
- [x] Added/updated instrumentation for new hot paths.

### Reliability

- [x] Error handling returns user-friendly and localized feedback.
- [x] Edge cases (empty data, malformed data, unavailable API) covered.
- [x] No mutation leaks from cached/shared objects.

### Code Quality

- [x] No avoidable duplication of defaults/constants.
- [x] View templates stay mostly presentational (logic in helper/service).
- [x] Naming and file structure follow existing project conventions.

### UX / A11y

- [x] Keyboard navigation works for new controls.
- [x] Focus indicators are visible and consistent.
- [x] Color contrast/readability remains acceptable on dark theme.
- [x] Mobile/tablet behavior reviewed for overflow and spacing.

### Verification

- [x] Relevant targeted tests pass.
- [x] Full test suite passes (`bin/rails test`).
- [x] No new warnings/errors from editor diagnostics.

## Validation Evidence

- Commands executed
  - `bundle exec rake lint`
  - `bundle exec rails test`
  - `bundle exec rake lint:md`
- Results
  - Lint passed.
  - Full suite passed (`27 runs, 0 failures, 0 errors`).
  - Markdown lint passed.
