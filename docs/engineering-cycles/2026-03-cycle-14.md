# Engineering Cycle Record — 2026-03 Cycle 14

## Cycle Metadata

- Cycle ID/Name: 2026-03 Cycle 14
- Date: 2026-03-01
- Owner: epsilva09 + GitHub Copilot
- Related issue/task: Materials table sticky header rendering too low
- Branch/PR: `main`

## Goals

- Fix broken sticky header positioning on materials table.
- Eliminate excessive vertical offset that pushed header too far down.
- Keep existing sticky filters + sticky header behavior.

## Implemented Changes

### 1) Performance

- Used `offsetHeight` first for sticky offset calculations to avoid unstable
  measurements across reflows.

### 2) Quality / Reliability

- Added proper toolbar class to materials filters header row for consistent
  vertical spacing.
- Added toolbar heading style reset to avoid inherited `h2` margins inflating
  sticky offset.
- Recalibrated sticky offset formula and reduced cap to prevent excessive
  displacement.

### 3) Architecture / Maintainability

- Reused existing toolbar pattern already used in progress filters.
- Kept sticky styles scoped and aligned with current CSS tokenized design.

### 4) UX / Accessibility

- Materials table header now remains visually aligned while scrolling and no
  longer appears much lower than expected.

## Risks / Trade-offs

- Offset cap tuning (`156px`) is conservative; if filters become significantly
  taller in future iterations, small overlap may occur and should be tuned.

## Definition of Done

### Functional

- [x] Behavior implemented matches intended user workflow.
- [x] New interactions are deterministic (no random layout jumps).
- [x] URL/state persistence is intentional and backwards-compatible.

### Performance

- [x] Expensive remote or CPU-heavy paths are cached where sensible.
- [x] New loops/parsing avoid repeated work when possible.
- [x] Added/updated instrumentation for new hot paths.

### Reliability

- [x] Error handling returns user-friendly and localized feedback.
- [x] Edge cases (empty data, malformed data, unavailable API) covered.
- [x] No mutation leaks from cached/shared objects.

### Code Quality

- [x] No avoidable duplication of defaults/constants.
- [x] View templates stay mostly presentational (logic in helper/service).
- [x] Naming and file structure follow existing project conventions.

### UX / A11y

- [x] Keyboard navigation works for new controls.
- [x] Focus indicators are visible and consistent.
- [x] Color contrast/readability remains acceptable on dark theme.
- [x] Mobile/tablet behavior reviewed for overflow and spacing.

### Verification

- [x] Relevant targeted tests pass.
- [x] Full test suite passes (`bin/rails test`).
- [x] No new warnings/errors from editor diagnostics.

## Validation Evidence

- Commands executed
  - `bundle exec rake lint`
  - `bundle exec rails test`
- Results
  - Lint passed.
  - Test suite passed.
