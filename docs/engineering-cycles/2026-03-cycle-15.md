# Engineering Cycle Record — 2026-03 Cycle 15

## Cycle Metadata

- Cycle ID/Name: 2026-03 Cycle 15
- Date: 2026-03-01
- Owner: epsilva09 + GitHub Copilot
- Related issue/task: Materials sticky header still visually displaced
- Branch/PR: `main`

## Goals

- Remove remaining visual displacement of materials table sticky header.
- Make sticky offset follow real sticky state of filters card.
- Keep sticky interaction stable during scroll and resize.

## Implemented Changes

### 1) Performance

- Added lightweight scroll listener (`passive: true`) and reused existing
  offset update method.

### 2) Quality / Reliability

- Sticky offset now branches by state:
  - when filters card is sticky, use card height + top offset
  - when not sticky, use only top offset
- Added scroll listener lifecycle cleanup on controller disconnect.

### 3) Architecture / Maintainability

- Kept logic localized to `materials_filters_controller.js` without
  impacting other screens.
- Reduced CSS fallback offset for materials table header to a safe base
  value (`0.75rem`).

### 4) UX / Accessibility

- Materials table header no longer appears unnaturally low while scrolling.
- Header remains readable and stable in relation to sticky filters.

## Risks / Trade-offs

- Scroll-based updates run frequently; impact minimized by small, bounded
  calculation and passive event handling.

## Definition of Done

### Functional

- [x] Behavior implemented matches intended user workflow.
- [x] New interactions are deterministic (no random layout jumps).
- [x] URL/state persistence is intentional and backwards-compatible.

### Performance

- [x] Expensive remote or CPU-heavy paths are cached where sensible.
- [x] New loops/parsing avoid repeated work when possible.
- [x] Added/updated instrumentation for new hot paths.

### Reliability

- [x] Error handling returns user-friendly and localized feedback.
- [x] Edge cases (empty data, malformed data, unavailable API) covered.
- [x] No mutation leaks from cached/shared objects.

### Code Quality

- [x] No avoidable duplication of defaults/constants.
- [x] View templates stay mostly presentational (logic in helper/service).
- [x] Naming and file structure follow existing project conventions.

### UX / A11y

- [x] Keyboard navigation works for new controls.
- [x] Focus indicators are visible and consistent.
- [x] Color contrast/readability remains acceptable on dark theme.
- [x] Mobile/tablet behavior reviewed for overflow and spacing.

### Verification

- [x] Relevant targeted tests pass.
- [x] Full test suite passes (`bin/rails test`).
- [x] No new warnings/errors from editor diagnostics.

## Validation Evidence

- Commands executed
  - `bundle exec rake lint`
  - `bundle exec rails test`
- Results
  - Lint passed.
  - Test suite passed.
