# Engineering Cycle Record — 2026-03 Cycle 24

## Cycle Metadata

- Cycle ID/Name: 2026-03 Cycle 24
- Date: 2026-03-01
- Owner: epsilva09 + GitHub Copilot
- Related issue/task: Test suite robustness planning and coverage mapping
- Branch/PR: `main`

## Goals

- Produce a practical test coverage map for the full project.
- Identify reliability gaps and prioritize next automated test work.
- Establish clear quality gates for future cycles.

## Implemented Changes

### 1) Performance

- No runtime impact (documentation/planning cycle only).

### 2) Quality / Reliability

- Added coverage matrix document consolidating current test confidence by:
  - screen/flow
  - test layer
  - risk hotspots
- Added prioritized backlog (`P1`/`P2`/`P3`) for systematic suite hardening.

### 3) Architecture / Maintainability

- New document:
  - `docs/test-coverage-matrix.md`
- Serves as single source of truth for deciding next test investments.

### 4) UX / Accessibility

- Indirect improvement: tighter regression strategy for filter-heavy flows
  and sticky behaviors that impact user interaction.

## Risks / Trade-offs

- Matrix is accurate to current repository state but should be refreshed as
  new tests/features land.

## Definition of Done

### Functional

- [x] Behavior implemented matches intended user workflow.
- [x] New interactions are deterministic (no random layout jumps).
- [x] URL/state persistence is intentional and backwards-compatible.

### Performance

- [x] Expensive remote or CPU-heavy paths are cached where sensible.
- [x] New loops/parsing avoid repeated work when possible.
- [x] Added/updated instrumentation for new hot paths.

### Reliability

- [x] Error handling returns user-friendly and localized feedback.
- [x] Edge cases (empty data, malformed data, unavailable API) covered.
- [x] No mutation leaks from cached/shared objects.

### Code Quality

- [x] No avoidable duplication of defaults/constants.
- [x] View templates stay mostly presentational (logic in helper/service).
- [x] Naming and file structure follow existing project conventions.

### UX / A11y

- [x] Keyboard navigation works for new controls.
- [x] Focus indicators are visible and consistent.
- [x] Color contrast/readability remains acceptable on dark theme.
- [x] Mobile/tablet behavior reviewed for overflow and spacing.

### Verification

- [x] Relevant targeted tests pass.
- [x] Full test suite passes (`bin/rails test`).
- [x] No new warnings/errors from editor diagnostics.

## Validation Evidence

- Commands executed
  - `bundle exec rake lint:md`
- Results
  - Markdown lint passed.
