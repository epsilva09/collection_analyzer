# Engineering Cycle Record — 2026-03 Cycle 11

## Cycle Metadata

- Cycle ID/Name: 2026-03 Cycle 11
- Date: 2026-03-01
- Owner: epsilva09 + GitHub Copilot
- Related issue/task: Sticky filters and table headers in Materials
- Branch/PR: `main`

## Goals

- Keep materials filters visible while scrolling down.
- Keep materials table headers visible during vertical scroll.
- Prevent overlap between sticky filters and sticky table headers.

## Implemented Changes

### 1) Performance

- Reused existing DOM cache and filter flow.
- Sticky offset is computed from current filters card height and updated on
  filter changes and window resize only.

### 2) Quality / Reliability

- Added deterministic sticky offset behavior in the Stimulus controller.
- Added resize listener lifecycle management (`connect`/`disconnect`).

### 3) Architecture / Maintainability

- Added dedicated class for sticky materials filters and table headers,
  avoiding side effects on other pages/tables.
- Added a specific table class to scope sticky header styles.

### 4) UX / Accessibility

- Filters now remain accessible while navigating long materials lists.
- Table column context remains visible via sticky header during scroll.

## Risks / Trade-offs

- Sticky stacking context depends on computed filter card height; behavior is
  mitigated with dynamic offset recalculation on input changes and resize.

## Definition of Done

### Functional

- [x] Behavior implemented matches intended user workflow.
- [x] New interactions are deterministic (no random layout jumps).
- [x] URL/state persistence is intentional and backwards-compatible.

### Performance

- [x] Expensive remote or CPU-heavy paths are cached where sensible.
- [x] New loops/parsing avoid repeated work when possible.
- [x] Added/updated instrumentation for new hot paths.

### Reliability

- [x] Error handling returns user-friendly and localized feedback.
- [x] Edge cases (empty data, malformed data, unavailable API) covered.
- [x] No mutation leaks from cached/shared objects.

### Code Quality

- [x] No avoidable duplication of defaults/constants.
- [x] View templates stay mostly presentational (logic in helper/service).
- [x] Naming and file structure follow existing project conventions.

### UX / A11y

- [x] Keyboard navigation works for new controls.
- [x] Focus indicators are visible and consistent.
- [x] Color contrast/readability remains acceptable on dark theme.
- [x] Mobile/tablet behavior reviewed for overflow and spacing.

### Verification

- [x] Relevant targeted tests pass.
- [x] Full test suite passes (`bin/rails test`).
- [x] No new warnings/errors from editor diagnostics.

## Validation Evidence

- Commands executed
  - `bundle exec rake lint:md`
  - `bundle exec rake lint`
  - `bundle exec rails test`
- Results
  - Markdown lint passed.
  - Combined lint passed.
  - Test suite passed.
