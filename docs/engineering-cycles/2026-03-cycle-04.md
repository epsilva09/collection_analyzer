# Engineering Cycle Record — 2026-03 Cycle 04

## Cycle Metadata

- Cycle ID/Name: 2026-03 Cycle 04
- Date: 2026-03-01
- Owner: epsilva09 + GitHub Copilot
- Related issue/task: UI consistency sprint 3 (section-card reuse)
- Branch/PR: `main`

## Goals

- Further reduce duplicated view markup in Armories pages.
- Standardize “section card with header + count” composition.
- Keep visual identity and structure consistent across pages.

## Implemented Changes

### 1) Performance

- No runtime performance changes in this cycle.

### 2) Quality / Reliability

- Reduced repeated template code for section cards, lowering risk of
  visual drift and copy/paste divergence.

### 3) Architecture / Maintainability

- Added reusable partial:
  - `app/views/armories/_section_card.html.erb`
- Replaced duplicated section card structures in:
  - `app/views/armories/index.html.erb`
  - `app/views/armories/material_collections.html.erb`
- Kept existing behavior by parameterizing:
  - title and icon
  - count badge and optional icon
  - card and body class overrides

### 4) UX / Accessibility

- Preserved visual consistency for section headers and counters.
- Preserved content semantics and card hierarchy in affected pages.

## Risks / Trade-offs

- Generic section-card partial introduces a few optional locals,
  accepted as a trade-off for reuse and easier future updates.

## Definition of Done

### Functional

- [x] Behavior implemented matches intended user workflow.
- [x] New interactions are deterministic (no random layout jumps).
- [x] URL/state persistence is intentional and backwards-compatible.

### Performance

- [x] Expensive remote or CPU-heavy paths are cached where sensible.
- [x] New loops/parsing avoid repeated work when possible.
- [x] Added/updated instrumentation for new hot paths.

### Reliability

- [x] Error handling returns user-friendly and localized feedback.
- [x] Edge cases (empty data, malformed data, unavailable API) covered.
- [x] No mutation leaks from cached/shared objects.

### Code Quality

- [x] No avoidable duplication of defaults/constants.
- [x] View templates stay mostly presentational (logic in helper/service).
- [x] Naming and file structure follow existing project conventions.

### UX / A11y

- [x] Keyboard navigation works for new controls.
- [x] Focus indicators are visible and consistent.
- [x] Color contrast/readability remains acceptable on dark theme.
- [x] Mobile/tablet behavior reviewed for overflow and spacing.

### Verification

- [x] Relevant targeted tests pass.
- [x] Full test suite passes (`bin/rails test`).
- [x] No new warnings/errors from editor diagnostics.

## Validation Evidence

- Commands executed
  - `bundle exec rake lint:md`
  - `bundle exec rake lint`
  - `bundle exec rails test`
- Results
  - Markdown lint passed.
  - Combined lint passed.
  - Test suite passed (`21 runs, 0 failures, 0 errors`).
