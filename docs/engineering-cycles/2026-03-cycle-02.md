# Engineering Cycle Record — 2026-03 Cycle 02

## Cycle Metadata

- Cycle ID/Name: 2026-03 Cycle 02
- Date: 2026-03-01
- Owner: epsilva09 + GitHub Copilot
- Related issue/task: UI consistency and visual identity standardization
  (Sprint 1)
- Branch/PR: `main`

## Goals

- Establish a reusable visual identity baseline for Armories pages.
- Reduce one-off visual variance across headings, cards, and empty states.
- Define project documentation for UI standards to guide future cycles.

## Implemented Changes

### 1) Performance

- No runtime performance changes in this cycle.

### 2) Quality / Reliability

- Kept lint and test pipeline stable after visual layer changes.

### 3) Architecture / Maintainability

- Added shared semantic visual tokens in `armory.css`:
  - typography tokens (`--armory-font-display`, `--armory-font-body`)
  - surface/text/border tokens (`--armory-surface-*`,
      `--armory-text-*`, `--armory-border-default`)
  - shape/shadow/spacing/motion tokens
- Added reusable identity utility classes:
  - `armory-page-header`, `armory-page-icon`
  - `armory-section-card`, `armory-empty-state`
- Documented standards in `docs/ui-identity-guidelines.md`.

### 4) UX / Accessibility

- Standardized page title treatment and icon styling across Armories
  pages.
- Standardized major section cards and empty-state visual behavior.
- Improved control/button consistency by normalizing interaction states
  (`hover`, `focus-visible`) over shared tokens.

## Risks / Trade-offs

- Visual normalization may slightly alter previous perceived contrast in
  isolated components; mitigated by keeping existing color palette and
  semantic variants.

## Definition of Done

### Functional

- [x] Behavior implemented matches intended user workflow.
- [x] New interactions are deterministic (no random layout jumps).
- [x] URL/state persistence is intentional and backwards-compatible.

### Performance

- [x] Expensive remote or CPU-heavy paths are cached where sensible.
- [x] New loops/parsing avoid repeated work when possible.
- [x] Added/updated instrumentation for new hot paths.

### Reliability

- [x] Error handling returns user-friendly and localized feedback.
- [x] Edge cases (empty data, malformed data, unavailable API) covered.
- [x] No mutation leaks from cached/shared objects.

### Code Quality

- [x] No avoidable duplication of defaults/constants.
- [x] View templates stay mostly presentational (logic in helper/service).
- [x] Naming and file structure follow existing project conventions.

### UX / A11y

- [x] Keyboard navigation works for new controls.
- [x] Focus indicators are visible and consistent.
- [x] Color contrast/readability remains acceptable on dark theme.
- [x] Mobile/tablet behavior reviewed for overflow and spacing.

### Verification

- [x] Relevant targeted tests pass.
- [x] Full test suite passes (`bin/rails test`).
- [x] No new warnings/errors from editor diagnostics.

## Validation Evidence

- Commands executed
  - `bundle exec rake lint:md`
  - `bundle exec rake lint`
  - `bundle exec rails test`
- Results
  - Markdown lint passed.
  - Combined lint passed.
  - Test suite passed (`21 runs, 0 failures, 0 errors`).
