## Definition of Done

### Functional

- [ ] Behavior implemented matches intended user workflow.
- [ ] New interactions are deterministic (no random layout jumps).
- [ ] URL/state persistence is intentional and backwards-compatible.

### Performance

- [ ] Expensive remote or CPU-heavy paths are cached where sensible.
- [ ] New loops/parsing avoid repeated work when possible.
- [ ] Added/updated instrumentation for new hot paths.

### Reliability

- [ ] Error handling returns user-friendly and localized feedback.
- [ ] Edge cases (empty data, malformed data, unavailable API) covered.
- [ ] No mutation leaks from cached/shared objects.

### Code Quality

- [ ] No avoidable duplication of defaults/constants.
- [ ] View templates stay mostly presentational (logic in helper/service).
- [ ] Naming and file structure follow existing project conventions.

### UX / A11y

- [ ] Keyboard navigation works for new controls.
- [ ] Focus indicators are visible and consistent.
- [ ] Color contrast/readability remains acceptable on dark theme.
- [ ] Mobile/tablet behavior reviewed for overflow and spacing.

### Verification

- [ ] Relevant targeted tests pass.
- [ ] Full test suite passes (`bin/rails test`).
- [ ] No new warnings/errors from editor diagnostics.
